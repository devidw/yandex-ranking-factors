= Yandex Ranking Factors

A few scrappy Deno scripts - mostly generated with GitHub Copilot - to transform the
leaked search ranking factors from Yandex from C++ Slice into JSON

Translations from Russian to English are made using DeepL API, expecting
`DEEPL_AUTH_KEY` env variable

For the generated results, see `./out`
